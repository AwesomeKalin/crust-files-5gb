## User Account and Sign-in

All users are asked to sign in Crust Files with a supported crypto wallet.

No user account. No password. Your wallet address is your unique identifier in Crust Files.

If you have no wallet, just get a <font color="red">Crust Wallet</font>.

### Requirements (How to become a Premium User)

A Premium User, to some extent, is Crust Files' formal user, because full benefits and capabilities naturally ask for a Crust Wallet and CRU payment (in some future features).

To become a Premium User, you need:

- Step 1: **Sign in** with a <font color="red">Crust Wallet</font>

- Step 2: **Deposit** a small amount of <font color="red">CRU Token</font> into a contract address. 
  - The deposit is fully redeemable after 6 months.
  - For early redeem, you get only 50% back.
  - After redeem, you lose your Premium User status.
  
## Deposit and Redeem Deposit

### Deposit

Go to Premium User page and deposit, which is an on-chain transaction on Crust blockchain.

On-chain finalization could take some time. After finalization, you will become a Premium User.

If you want to make a valid `Deposit Transaction` on your own (outside of Crust Files frontend), follow this instruction:

### Redeem Deposit

You can redeem your deposit anytime, but remember there will be a 50% loss for early redeem.

Go to Premium User page and send a Redeem Deposit requirement, which is still an on-chain transaction on Crust blockchain.

Redeem Deposit will be processed on daily basis by Crust Files. You have to wait for no more than 24 hours to get your deposited CRU back to your wallet address.

If you want to make a valid `Redeem Reposit Transaction` on your own (outside of Crust Files frontend), follow this instruction:
