### Requirements (How to become a Premium User)

A Premium User, to some extent, is Crust Files' formal user, because full benefits and capabilities naturally ask for a Crust Wallet and CRU payment (in some future features).

To become a Premium User, you need:

- Step 1: **Sign in** with a <font color="red">Crust Wallet</font>

- Step 2: **Deposit** a small amount of <font color="red">CRU Token</font> into a contract address. 
  - The deposit is redeemable after 180 days (counted by block height on Crust's blockchain).
  - After redeem, you lose your Premium User status and all of the corresponding benefits.
