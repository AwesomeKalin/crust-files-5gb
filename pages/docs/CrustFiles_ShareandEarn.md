# Share-and-Earn

<font size={6}>Share files to your friends and invite them to use Crust Files.</font>

<font size={6}>Enjoy and Earn $CRU !!!</font>

## Basically:
1. Share files to your friends and invite them to use Crust Files.
2. For every effective invitation (as your friend becomes a Premium User), you get <font color="red">**1 $CRU**</font> reward.

## Initiatives

Actually we never want Share-and-Earn to be a mere tricky, old-fashioned invite-and-earn promotion gimmick.

Crust Files is designed to be a practical product for the next generation web coming soon, which is generally known as Web3.0. This is why we truly want everyone to use Crust Files, enjoy Crust Files, and learn more about what's behind Crust Files. By using Crust Files, you are being part of this awesome Web3.0 future.

Just sign in with your crypto wallet, store a file, create a share link and give it to your friends. You will absolutely get <font color="orange">**100% cool Web3.0 features and 200% sharing pleasure**</font> together with your Share-and-Earn rewards!

## Prerequisites
